# the Mountain Goats Online eXchange

This website is an experiment in converting a web app from React to Vue.

It pings the Discogs API for the lowest current prices for the first five (terribly rare) Mountain Goats albums on vinyl, as well as populating links to each marketplace listing.

A test build is viewable [here](https://tmgvue.vercel.app/).
